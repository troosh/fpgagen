**fpgagen** is an attempt to clone the SEGA Megadrive/Genesis console in a FPGA.
It is currently advanced enough to run many games.

In order to run this project you will need :
  * A Terasic/Altera DE1 board.
  * A VGA monitor.

For more information, see the README in the Downloads section.

UPDATE : added a preview of my PC-Engine/Turbografx-16 clone, see the Downloads section.
